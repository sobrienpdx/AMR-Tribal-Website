          <h2>About AMR Incorporated</h2>
          <p>AMR Inc. works exclusively with Indian Country organizations including tribal government's, housing authorities, health clinics, enterprises, and other Tribal entities.

          Our success includes the most difficult issues facing Tribal organizations. We deliver Solutions creating long-term value. Our commitment to developing strong, accurate, and timely accounting is an integral part of our strategy for success. Our approach is hands-on, on-site, and is based on building capacity and infrastructure sufficient to support the current and future needs of the organization.

          In all of our projects, we work closely with management and Council to identify goals and priorities, establish key milestones, and manage change.  Examples of typical project accomplishments include:
